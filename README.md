# ChordNet

In traditional music theory, there are many guidelines and rules when writing chord progressions for four voice parts. This is also referred to as four-part harmony. This project develops a multi-output regression model, ChordNet, to take a current chord and return the correct voicings for the next chord.

"Tonal Harmony" (Kostka & Payne) is a popular music theory textbook that was used as the basis for this project. For example, the vocal ranges for each part were set as dictated in the book, and over 300 example chord progresions were used as 'seeds' for the dataset.
